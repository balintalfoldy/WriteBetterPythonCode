#! We increased the cohesion,  i.e. Order and PaymentProcessor have one responsibility
#! but we introduced some coupling
#! If we want to extend the PaymentProcessor, we have to modify the class it self (violates Open/Closed principle!!!)
#! Optimally we would want to do a structure of classes and subclasses that we can just define
#! subclass for new payment method i.e. Abstract class and subclasses
